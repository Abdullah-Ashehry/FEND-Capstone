# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Testing 
run : 
npm run test

## Extras
Implemented : 
geoCountry
Pull in an image for the country from Pixabay API when the entered location brings up no results (good for obscure localities).
Add end date and display length of trip.
Integrate the REST Countries API to pull in data for the country being visited.
